Flutter Exercise The Movie
---

# This is a mobile application built with Flutter that consumes the API provided by https://www.themoviedb.org/. The app displays a list of popular movies and allows users to view the details of each movie.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a mobile application using Flutter that consumes the endpoints exposed through a public API for developers. The application should display a list of the most popular movies and allow users to access the details of each movie. A state manager should be used to facilitate the structuring of data. The source code should be uploaded to Github with a corresponding Readme.md file that provides instructions for deploying and testing the application.
