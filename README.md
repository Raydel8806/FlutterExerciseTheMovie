Flutter Exercise The Movie
---

# This is a mobile application built with Flutter that consumes the API provided by https://www.themoviedb.org/. The app displays a list of popular movies and allows users to view the details of each movie.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a mobile application using Flutter that consumes the endpoints exposed through a public API for developers. The application should display a list of the most popular movies and allow users to access the details of each movie. A state manager should be used to facilitate the structuring of data. The source code should be uploaded to Github with a corresponding Readme.md file that provides instructions for deploying and testing the application.
 

## Getting Started üöÄ

Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run flutter pub get to install the 
   dependencies.
3. Update a assets/.env file in the root directory 
4. This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Flutterexercisethemovie works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

## Conclusion
This application provides a simple way for users to view popular movies and their details. The use of functional programming with dependency injection and BLoC makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
  "@@locale": "en",
  "screenPopularsFilmsAppBarTitle": "Populars Films",
  "@screenPopularsFilmsAppBarTitle ": {
    "description": "Text displayed in the AppBar of the main page"
  },
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "screenPopularsFilmsAppBarTitle": "Populars Films",
    "@screenPopularsFilmsAppBarTitle ": {
         "description": "Text displayed in the AppBar of the main page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
         "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:flutterexercisethemovie/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
```
